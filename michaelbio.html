Looking back over my life, I can’t imagine where I would be if I let my past misfortunes put and keep me down. Starting at birth, the doctors at Christ Hospital saw my ultrasound and predicted that I would have a brain tumor and be mentally disabled. Fortunately, they were wrong. This taught from a young age that although I didn’t  know my purpose in life at the time, I was being spared from sickness to find that purpose. This inspired me to take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. One night I spent the night at my cousin’s house, and as I entered his room I was overwhelmed by the drawings and paintings posted around his room. I told myself that night, ”Whatever I do in life, I want it to involve this”. Therefore, I practiced drawing every day and night until I became the artist I wanted to be. I miss being the kid everyone came up to for advice on how to improve their projects. Now that I’m an adult, I find myself asking other artists better than me on how to improve my projects. Apart of being successful is knowing how to improvise. Therefore,I am prepared for the unexpected changes in life because those times let me know that success is near.
