<br>
<br>
 . . .
<br>
<br>
If there is one thing that life has taught me, it is everything won’t always go according as planned. In the midst of reflecting back over my life, I can’t imagine where I would be if I let my past misfortunes keep me down. 
<br>
<br> 
Starting at birth, based off an ultra sound and lack of hope. . I was predicted to develop a brain tumor and become mentally disabled. Fortunately, they were wrong and this taught me a lesson at a young age which I didn’t know the value of at that time. I was being spared from sickness to find that meaning and purpose in life which only I could figure out. This experience has inspired me to take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. 
<br>
<br>
One night I witness my cousin’s amazing artwork and became overwhelmed by the drawings and paintings posted around his room that I told myself. . .  ”Anything that I do in life, I want it to be involve with this”. Therefore, I practiced drawing rigorously until I became the artist I wanted to be. 
<br>
<br>
As I gotten older, I pursue my passion to learn and experience more. I am prepared for the unexpected changes in life because of those times that allowed me to be blessed and know that success is near!""

― Michael Drake Jr.
